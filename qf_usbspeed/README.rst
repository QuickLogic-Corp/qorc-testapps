QuickFeather USB Speed Test
===========================

The qf_usbspeed application is a simple application that can be used to
test the write performance of the USB serial link.

The application uses the HW UART (TX and RX pins on QuickFeather) for
control, and the USB serial IP attached to the microUSB connector for
data transfer.

To use the application, connect the USB cable to a USB port on your
computer, and connect a serial-to-USB between another USB port and the
RX & TX pins on QuickFeather. From a command prompt connect a virtual
terminal, such as PuTTY to each of the USB ports. The baud rate of the
PuTTY connected to the HW UART should be set to 115,200. The application
will use this terminal as a console. You control the write activity
using the CLI (Command Line Interface) on the console. The baud rate on
the PuTTY connected to the USB serial port is ignored.

To measure USB write performance, enter the usb submenu and issue the
'write' command. The write command will ask for the number of bytes to
write, and when that is entered it will write that many bytes on the USB
serial port. You will see data on the PuTTY connected to the USB serial
port, and when the write is completed you will see the elasped time on
the console.
