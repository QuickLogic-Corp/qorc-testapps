QuickFeather Baremetal Test
===========================

This is a minimal test/example application which can serve as a template for "bare metal" applications.

None of the FreeRTOS components are used.

The application just prints out a banner on the EOS S3 UART and does nothing else.

  NOTE: Cleanup of code to remove remnants of unused headers to be done.
